Create Windows ISO file
  Step 1: Visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 and download the windows media creation tool

Setting Up Windows 10 VM
  Step 1: Click "New" to make new VM




Notes: 
- Had an issue entering windows setup the first time booting. The first thing I tried doing was boot into the bios to change the boot order, but it kept giving me the same error. The way I fixed the problem was powering off the VM and disable the floppy disk drive completely.
