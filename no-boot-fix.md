# Troubleshooting a No Boot Issue on Windows 10 VM

## Goal
Simulate and resolve a no-boot scenario on my Windows 10 VM to practice help desk troubleshooting.

## Setup
- Host: Windows 11 PC
- VM: “PC1” (Windows 10, 4GB RAM, 20GB disk)
- Tools: VirtualBox 7.0.12

## Steps
1. Broke the VM
3. Booted VM, saw error: “No bootable medium”
4. Fixed it: reattached disk in Storage.
5. Tested: VM booted to desktop, ran Notepad.

## Outcome
Restored VM to working state—ready for more tests.

## Summary (Why I Did This)
- Wanted to mimic a common help desk call—PC won’t boot—and solve it with A+ skills.

## Notes (What I Learned)
- [Fill in after—e.g., “Safe Mode’s quick for boot fixes—took 15 minutes.”]
